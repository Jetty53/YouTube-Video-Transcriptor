you journey

my destination is yours

survive without

Oh my heart, you are difficult for me

I survived without you in my prayers

Oh my heart, it's hard for me

I miss you in the sky

You are my essential passion for every lack.

I will become worthy of you, it is difficult for me to live without you, O heart!

This body is also mine

not that much mine

You have given whatever is yours.

Not Bhojpuri right

I have met you

my name is mera mera

Search for the sky, your land is mine

Naat Sharif on every land is necessary for every need.

So I lived without you in the sky

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil song, there is no other way to live, neither does my heart know how passionately I love you, even if your eyes

I am more beautiful than my destination

You are responsible for every deficiency, even though you are incomplete.

This is love, my job is to live without you

Oh my heart is difficult
